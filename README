What's this?

Well ruby has facets, I couldn't find anything like that for python. What that
is, is a collection of small useful little tools programmers will need to use
over and over again, so why are we all writing our own? We can re-use
each-others work and concentrate on the higher level end result with the
obvious gains to productivity. Let's do it, add your little bits and pieces,
let's make this like the standard library, but a bit less standard ;)
